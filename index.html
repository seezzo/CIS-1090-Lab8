  <h1>CIS-1090-Lab8</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Lab 8. Up until now we have been running our code in the terminal, with text being the only method of
    input and output available to us. Lots of tools work this way, but a lot of the JavaScript in the world is running
    in web browsers, adding interactive functionality to web pages.

  <!-- Part One, Learn about elements and events -->
  <!--<h2>We can count how many times you click a button:</h2>
  <button id="button">Click Me</button>
  <div id="count">0</div>
  <script type="module" src="/counter.js"></script>
  -->
  
  <!-- Part Two, a game -->
  <h2>Or create a game:</h2>
  <p>
    I made this game for you. I call it <b>Clickin' Chicken</b>. The object of the game is to click on the chicken.

  <div id="game">

  </div>
  <script type="module" src="/game.js"></script>
